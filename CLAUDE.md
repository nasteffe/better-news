- Key directories and their purpose
- Data flow and state management approach
- External services and APIs

## Code Conventions

_To be established._ When conventions are adopted, document:

- Naming conventions (files, variables, functions, classes)
- File and directory organization patterns

## Key Guidelines for AI Assistants

1. **Read before modifying** — Always read existing files before proposing changes
2. **Minimal changes** — Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary
3. **No over-engineering** — Avoid adding abstractions, utilities, or features beyond what is asked
4. **Security first** — Do not introduce vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, credential exposure, etc.)
5. **Update this file** — When adding significant infrastructure, dependencies, or conventions, update CLAUDE.md to reflect the current state
